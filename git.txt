git

git -> version control system
- a way to store your code

github -> "google drive" for code
- use git to "upload" code to github

commands
- git status -> self explanatory
- git add [file] -> adds a file to be committed
- git commit -> takes a "snapshot" of your codebase
- git push -> upload it to whatever github repository

workflow
- git status (show everything that you want to add to github)
- git add . (add all the files you changed)
- git commit -m "Your message here"
- git push origin main (uploads to github)
